Extra Credit
• Assign the characters into numbers, and then use printf to print them one character at
a time. What kind of compiler warnings do you get?
• Do the inverse for name, trying to treat it like an array of int and print it out one int at
a time. What does the debugger think of that?
• In how many other ways can you print this out?
• If an array of characters is 4 bytes long, and an integer is 4 bytes long, then can you treat
the whole name array like it’s just an integer? How might you accomplish this crazy hack?
• Take out a piece of paper and draw each of these arrays as a row of boxes. Then do the
operations you just did on paper to see if you get them right.
• Convert name to be in the style of another and see if the code keeps working.
